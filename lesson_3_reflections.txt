when would you want to create a new repoistory rather than keeping all the work manually?
when you want to add your files to github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives you a chance to pull whatever changes that you wish to move to your
local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Fork  - used when you want to copy a repository on the Github
Clone - used when you want to copy a repository from github to your local computer or between 
two local computers
Branch - when you want to do some experiment on the exiting repository
